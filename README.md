I am a Game Developer from Paris.

I have worked on various technologies, such as AR, VR, MR and games.

I am using C# and the Unity engine since 2015, but I am interested to try new technologies.

## Key game projects at Voodoo

All features were developed using the AB testing method.

### Aquapark.io
[Appstore link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aquapark-io/id1453989822)

#### Pre-launch development - optimization - debugging

Aquapark is the biggest hyper casual game hit of 2019, staying first in global app downloads all summer. 
It was thrilling to be in charge of the publishing of this project.

### Draw Joust

#### Pre-launch development - game design

I joined Draw Joust at an earlier conception stage than the other projects, and had a great relationship
with the creators. Together we managed to find a way to make the game engaging and faster paced.

### WoodTurning

#### Pre-launch development - addition of meta features

I helped on WoodTurning to retain the players longer with different features: a tool selection to better
express the creativity of the player, and a visual upgrade to the shop as the game progresses.

### Paper.io 2

#### UI/UX rework

Paper.io 2 is one of the staples of the Voodoo library, and I helped give it a fresh look by 
reworking its UI/UX with the art team.

### Hole.io

#### Developing a halloween event in-game

Another staple of the Voodoo collection that I worked on as a Live Ops developer, long after
its launch. The halloween event included a lot of new art content.

### Scribble Rider

#### Pre-launch development

I helped refine the drawing tool of Scribble Rider, so that people could accurately draw
wheels for their cars without any frustration.

### Color Road

#### Game rework from the ground up

Willing to give an old game a breath of fresh air, we decided to rework on Color Road to
give it a gameplay more in line with popular titles of 2022.
